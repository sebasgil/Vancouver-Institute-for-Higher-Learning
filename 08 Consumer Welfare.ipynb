    "In the search for quantitative models, economists aim to understand how consumers are benefitted or hindered by shocks affecting the equilibrium price and quantity of goods and services for a given market. On one hand, price changes from advancements in technology or the striking of new business deals by corporations. On the other, quantities change when a government sets a quota. In an ideal scenario, economists aim to measure the **utility of a consumer**, corresponding to the happiness that a consumer obtains from buying a product or service.

Indeed, this is an issue that was recognized by Jeremy Bentham, who along with John Stuart Mill was a founder of the philosophical school of utilitarianism. In their view, the merits of human acts such as business decisions, legislation and even crime and punishment should be judged strictly in terms of the pleasure or pain that these acts effect on human beings. As explained by the Princeton economist [Uwe E. Reinhardt](https://www.princeton.edu/~reinhard/pdfs/100-NEXT_HOW_ECONOMISTS_BASTARDIZED_BENTHAMITE_UTILITARIANISM.pdf), Bentham sought to quantify happiness in units of utility.\n",

    "The difficulty, he found, was in establishing the **cardinality** of utility (we will explain cardinality shortly), as well as accounting for inter-personal dependencies of utility--the relative pleasure that different individuals would assign to the same good. Attempting to assign a calculus to such a function would be as well rather difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, Bentham argued that the *marginal utility of wealth should be strongly diminishing* and wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    ">*\"Of two people having unequal fortunes, he who has most wealth must by a legislator be regarded as having most happiness. But the quantity of happiness will not go on increasing in anything near the same proportion as the quantity of wealth: ten thousand times the quantity of wealth will not bring with it ten thousand times the quantity of happiness.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">*It will even be matter of doubt, whether ten thousand times the wealth will in general bring with it twice the happiness. The effect of wealth in the production of\n",
    "happiness goes on diminishing, as the quantity by which the wealth of one man exceeds that of another goes on increasing: In other words, the quantity of happiness produced by a particle of wealth (each particle being of the same magnitude) will be less at every particle; the second will produce less than the first, the third than the second, and so on.\"*\n",

Think about the goals that you want to accomplish in life: the things you want to buy, the places you want to visit, the people you want to associate with. How much money do you think would make you 'happy'? How does happiness cale with income?\n",

    "If obtaining a quantitative measure for subjective happiness is wrought with difficulty, how are we to proceed? Conventionally, economists choose to measure *consumer welfare in terms of dollars*.

You know that you could get an identical bottle for $\\$2.00$ at the store, but chances are that you are so thirsty that you don't mind paying $\\$3.00$ in excess of what you would normally pay.

But it is, unhappily, certain that the historical spirit itself is lacking in them, that precisely all the good spirits of history itself have left them in the lurch! As is the hallowed custom with philosophers, the thinking of all of them is by nature unhistorical; there is no doubt about that. The way they have bungled their moral genealogy comes to light at the very beginning, where the task is to investigate the origin of the concept and judgement 'good'. 'Originally'--so they decree--'one approved unegoistic actions and called them good for the point of view of those to whom they were done, that is to say, those to whom they were useful, later one forgot how this approval orignated and, simply because unegositic actions were always habitually praised as good, one also felt them to be good--as if they were something good in themselves'. One sees straightaway that this primary derivation already contains all the typical traits of the idiosyncrasy of the English psychologists--we have '**utility**', 'forgetting', 'habit', and finally 'error', all as the basis of an evaluation of which the higher man has hitherto been proud as though it were a kind of prerogative of man as such. This pride has to be humbled, this evaluation disvalued: has that end been achieved?\n",
    "> Now it is plain to me, first of all, that in this theory the concept of the concept 'good' has been sought and established in the wrong place: the judgement 'good' did not orignate with those to whom 'goodness' was shown! Rather it was the 'good' themselves, that is to say, the noble, powerful, high-stationed and high-minded, who felt and establsihed themselves and their actions as good, that is, of the first rank, in contradistinction to all the low, low-minded, common and plebeian.
