    "We can use the production function of a company to determine an expression for the cost function. This is achieved by multiplying the quantity of each business input by its price. For example, if a firm is to only use labor and capital as its inputs and capital is fixed in the short-run, it follows that the variable cost is **only determined by labor**. For example, a fully stocked hot-dog stand needs the labor of the salesman to run. We can categofize all all the direct and indirect costs of preparing the hot dog stand as fixed capital $\\bar{K}$ and keep the labor of the salesman as the sole determinant for variable cost so that $\\text{VC} = wL$ where $w$ is the worker's wage."

The extra labor required to produce one more unit of output is $dL/dq = 1/MP_L$ The extra labor costs the firm $w$ per unit (the worker's wage), so the firm's cost rises by $w(dL/dq)$.

Indeed, a common criticism of this model is that Cobb and Douglas were influenced by statistical evidence that appeared to show that labor and capital shares of total output were constant over time in developed countries. They subsequently explained these observations in terms of statistical fitting least-squares regression of their production function. Moreover, the shape of the function was chosen not to reflect available knowledge of engineering, technology (or even thermodynamics!). Instead, it was chosen to be consistent with the **law of diminishing marginal returns** at the expense of other empirical data. Despite these flaws, the Cobb-Douglas model is still the standard use for analysis of production across various levels of industry."
