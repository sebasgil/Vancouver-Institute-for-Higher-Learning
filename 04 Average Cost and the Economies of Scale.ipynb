Despite these risks, the possibility of substantially decreasing the cost per unit produced--the **average cost**-- is a big incentive to undertake such expenditures."

For the sake of simplicity, microeconomics makes the usual assumption that cost functions are of this form, referring to them as **U-shaped curves**. This, however is an idealization that may not always be fulfilled by real world data. Indeed, there is evidence to show that the cost functions for real businesses are not always U-shaped. In a survey by Wilford J. Eiteman and Glenn E. Guthrie in 1952, managers of 334 companies were shown a number of different cost curves, and asked to specify which one best represented the company’s cost curve. 95% of managers responding to the survey reported cost curves with constant or falling costs.

    "An upwards facing parabola is bound to increase past its minimum point. In terms of cost functions, this interval of increase is identified with the **diseconomies of scale**. Efficiency and productivity can scale positively with firm size up to some optimal value. Thus, once a firm exceeds a critical size, an increase in production will actually hinder its productivity and hurt its revenue. Common limits in production include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, pulp and paper industry.In addition, diseconomies are related to the management problems of trying to control and direct an organization with many thousands of workers, in many separate divisions, often operating in several different countries. We may thus attribute diseconomies of scale to two main factors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Communication problems** Large-scale operations will often lead to poor feedback to workers, excessive use of non-personal communication media, communication overload with the volume of messages being sent, and distotion of messages caused by the long chain of command. Poor feedback reduces worker incentives. These problems may lead to poor decisions being made, due to inadequate or delayed information, and management inefficiency.\n",

They may feel insignificant in the overall business plan and become demotivated, failing to do their best. Larger manufacturing firms are the ones most likely to adopt flow-line production and worforce alienation is a real problem due to repetitive and boring tasks."
