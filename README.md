# Vancouver-Institute-for-Higher-Learning
Pedagogical Notebooks for the VIHL, 2017


These are my lectures notes for the two courses I taught in the Spring Session of the [Vancouver Institute for Higher Learning](https://www.higherlearning.today/). For more information about the Institute, please refer to the website.



## Programming Lab

The course is intended as a hand-on introduction to computer programming with an emphasis on core computational skills for science undergraduates. 
In developing this material, I greatly benefited from the following resources:

* [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
* [NB Viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
* [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/)



## Business Calculus
