## Programming Lab

The course is intended as a hand-on introduction to computer programming with an emphasis on core computational skills for high school students who want to enroll in a science undergraduate program. 
In developing this material, I greatly benefited from the following resources:

* [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
* [NB Viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
* [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/)



## Business Calculus

This course is intended as an application of the ideas of differential and integral calculus commonly presented as part of the IB/AP program towards the examination of concepts and scenarios from business and economics. Students are expected to extend their knowledge of derivatives and integrals through consideration of real-world scenarios. In developing the content for the lectures, I used mainly three resources:

* [Stewart, Calculus](http://www.stewartcalculus.com/index.php), particularly the problems related to applications of calculus to economics which I subsequently modified for my lectures
* [Perloff, Microeconomics: Theory and Applications with Calculus](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Perloff-Microeconomics-Theory-and-Applications-with-Calculus/9780321277947.html)
* [Stimpson and Smith, Business and Management for the IB Diplomma](http://abdurs.yolasite.com/resources/b%26m%20ebook.pdf)
